# TEMPer1X CLI
Interface for PCSensor USB thermometer.

I could not get anything out of my USB thermometer in OSX. After looking online I found a application that worked fine but I wanted CLI. I stripped out the Objective-C GUI and the frameworks to the bare minimum.

Original code and all the merit goes to Sledgehammer Solutions Limited
